# Sprite Flipper

Welcome to **Sprite Flipper**, a simple tool that allows you to reverse the orientation of all sprites in your sprite sheet!

## Features

- Upload sprite sheets in PNG or JPEG format.
- Preview your uploaded sprite sheet directly in the app.
- Set the width of a single sprite frame.
- Set the height of your sprite sheet.
- Reverse the orientation of all sprites with a single click.
- Download the modified sprite sheet.

## How to Use

1. **Upload Your Sprite Sheet**:
    - Only PNG and JPEG formats are supported.
    - Get a preview of your uploaded image immediately.

2. **Set Sprite Frame Width**:
    - Determine the width of a single frame in your sprite sheet.
    - This is calculated by taking the full width of your sprite sheet and dividing it by the number of sprites. (Note: You'll need to perform this calculation yourself.)

3. **Set Sprite Sheet Height**:
    - Simply input the height of your uploaded sprite sheet.

4. **Flip and Preview**:
    - Once you've set both the frame width and sprite sheet height, click the "Flip Sprites" button.
    - View the modified sprite sheet with all sprites reversed in orientation.

5. **Download**:
    - Download the modified sprite sheet to use in your projects.

## Limitations

Currently, only PNG and JPEG formats are supported. Other image formats are not compatible with Sprite Flipper.
